# Logistic Regression from Scratch

### About
In this project, we will take a look at the logistic regression algorithm and 
build a custom binary classifier. The main idea of the project is to implement 
gradient descent for two different cost functions, devise a method to predict 
the probability that a given sample belongs to a certain class, and analyze 
training errors. And last but not least — put your models to the test on a 
real dataset.

### Learning Outcomes of the Project:
Come to know logistic regression. Learn the math behind it and implement a 
solution that will be on par with the one from sklearn. Study two kinds of cost 
function — Mean Squared Error and Log Loss. These concepts will give you the 
freedom to combine different tools for solving complex problems.

### Learning Outcomes of Each Stage of the Project
_Stage 1_ : Predict probabilities with a sigmoid function.

_Stage 2_ : Fit a method when the cost function is the Mean squared error.

_Stage 3_ : Build a fit method with a Log-loss cost function.

_Stage 4_ : Make the final touches on the algorithm and compare between models.

# General Info

To learn more about this project, please visit 
[HyperSkill Website - Logistic Regression from Scratch](https://hyperskill.org/projects/219).

This project's difficulty has been labelled as __Challenging__ where this is how 
HyperSkill describes each of its four available difficulty levels:

- __Easy Projects__ - if you're just starting
- __Medium Projects__ - to build upon the basics
- __Hard Projects__ - to practice all the basic concepts and learn new ones
- __Challenging Projects__ - to perfect your knowledge with challenging tasks

This Repository contains one .py file:

    code.py - Contains the code used to complete the Logistic Regression models

Project was built using python version 3.11.3

# How to Run

Download the code.py file to your local repository and open the project in your choice 
IDE and run the project. A custom regression model class was written and implemented
to compare the performance of different models that use different cost functions to output the
optimal weight parameters. Their performance was compared to the Logistic Regression model
provided by sklearn. Please read each Stage's docstring to know the requirements 
of each stage and understand the output of the program.
